This app imports the spool from the kbreview Usenet forum, using
acts_as_nested_set to preserve the threading of the posts. It applies
a few rules to analyze the nature of the posts:

1. The first post in a thread is a Post requesting peer review of a document.
2. The first child posts by authors other than the original author are Reviews of the document.
3. Any other posts by the authors of 1. or 2. are Replies to peer review comments.

Once the posts have been analyzed into Posts, Reviews, and Replies,
they are broken down by time period and displayed per author, both of
which are user-selectable. After selecting a user and time period, the
message totals can be turned into a line graph.
